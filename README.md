### Hi there, my name is Adam Grounds and welcome to my GitHub page!
- On this repository, you can expect to find some of my current projects as well as projects I worked on in school.
- I’m interested in learning more about how to write better C#, Java, and JavaScript code.
- I’m currently learning the React framework and soon will start Redux and NodeJS.
- I strongly encourage you to let me know if you have suggestions of how to improve my code, I always want to get better! 
Please feel free to open up an issue in the project you have a suggestion for and I'll do my best to get back to you.
