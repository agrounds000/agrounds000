### Hi there, my name is Adam Grounds and welcome to my GitHub page!
- On this repository, you can expect to find some of my current projects as well as projects I worked on in school. Please note that each repository
  may have unique projects. There's no need to rewrite the same code in a different language if it's similar enough.
- I’m interested in learning more about how to write better C#, Java, and JavaScript code.
- I strongly encourage you to let me know if you have suggestions of how to improve my code, I always want to get better! 
Please feel free to send me a message on here or on Linkedin for suggestions or other improvements and I'll do my best to get back to you.


I will try to upload new and interesting things as I come up with ideas and time allows.
