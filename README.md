### Hi there, my name is Adam Grounds and welcome to my GitHub page!
- On this repository, you can expect to find some of my current projects as well as projects I worked on in school. Please note that each repository
  may have unique projects. There's no need to rewrite the same code in a different language if it's similar enough.
- I’m interested in learning more about how to write better C#, Java, and JavaScript code.
- I’m currently learning the React framework and soon will start Redux and NodeJS.
- I strongly encourage you to let me know if you have suggestions of how to improve my code, I always want to get better! 
Please feel free to send me a message on here or on Linkedin for suggestions or other improvements and I'll do my best to get back to you.


New projects or improvements should be uploaded every few days, so be sure to check back often!
